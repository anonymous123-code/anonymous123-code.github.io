I just released my first Fabric mod!

Endermantic overhaul is available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/endermantic-overhaul) and [GitHub](https://github.com/anonymous123-code/endermanticOverhaul).
It is a small mod adding two Blocks, the Ender Force Concentrator, which forces nearby Endermen to teleport in front of it, and the Negative End Force Emitter, which forces nearby Endermen to place the block they are holding in front of it. It also makes it so that Dispensers give blocks to Endermen.

I plan on further improving on it by:
- Fixing a bug that the blogs aren't updated when placed. This leads to illegal Blockstate Configurations.
- Making the crafting recipe for the Negative End Force Emitter Data-Driven. Currently, it is hardcoded to convert when an enderman places a Block in the Nether. I want it to work with custom Recipe Types and Predicates.
- I also plan to port it to [Quilt][quilt-website] when [Quilt][quilt-website] releases.

It'll also have a Booth at the [BlanketCon](https://blanketcon.modfest.net/#). Come and check it out!

If you are invested in any kind of Minecraft dev, being it Plugins, Ressource Packs, Data Packs or Mods, feel free to [apply for a Booth or Event](https://blanketcon.modfest.net/signup), too.

I also recommend joining the [Quilt](https://discord.quiltmc.org/) and [Modfest + BlanketCon Discord](https://discord.gg/gn543Ee) Server.
